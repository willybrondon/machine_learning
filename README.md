# machine_learning
Many machine learning projects 
Here is many project for machine learning.
It is very detail.

Many methods have been used : Naives Bayes, Neural Network, MLPClassifier
The diffrent projects are:
Facies classification,
Prediction ( man or woman),
How to construct a Receiver Operating Characteristic,
Neural Network with tensorflow.

There are many libraries that need to be install : sklearn, scipy, keras, pandas, numpy, matplolib
